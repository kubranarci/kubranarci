# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋  

I'm **Kübra Narcı**, a Bioinformatician at the **GHGA Workflows Team/DKFZ**, specializing in developing [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) pipelines. With a strong passion for creating reproducible and FAIR-compliant workflows, I contribute to advancing bioinformatics standards and tools.  

I’m also proud to be a **Nextflow Ambassador**, actively supporting and promoting the Nextflow community by sharing knowledge and best practices in workflow development.  

## 🔬 About Me  

- **Role:** Bioinformatician and Bioinformatics Workflow Engineer 
- **Location:** Heidelberg, Germany  
- **Organization:** [GHGA](https://github.com/ghga-de) / [DKFZ-ODCF](https://github.com/DKFZ-ODCF)  
- **Values:** Reproducibility, FAIR Principles, Community Collaboration  

As the **main developer of [nf-core/variantbenchmarking](https://github.com/nf-core/variantbenchmarking)**, I focus on providing standardized workflows for benchmarking variant-calling pipelines.  

## 🎓 Workshops
